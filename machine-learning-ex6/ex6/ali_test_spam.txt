Hi Ali,

I'm sharing 3 links of Telepresence with you with regards to:

1. Connecting Telepresence with Google Calendar so the user can see the Telepresence conference room's availability and book it

2. Allowing viewing availability and booking of Telepresence conference room from a device placed outside the conference room
